# CTI Publicus

Cyber threat intelligence derived from publicly available information (PAI) using open-source intelligence (OSINT) collection methods. This repository hosts course materials, examples, and resources for the [CTI Publicus](https://open.openclass.ai/invite?code=tfDg7nXFzf6BEA) class on OpenClass.ai. Students will learn how to gather and analyze narrative-format threat data, integrate feeds from public services (e.g., OpenCTI, AlienVault), and document findings without relying on paywalled or internal network logs. Contributions, issues, and suggestions are welcome to help improve public CTI methodologies and resources.
